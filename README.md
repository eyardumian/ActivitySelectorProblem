# ActivitySelectorProblem
The activity selection problem involves finding the maximum size set of mutually compatible activities, given the start and end time of each activity. This program solves the activity selection problem using a recursive approach and a greedy, iterative approach.
It also collects the running time of each algorithm to demonstrate that the iterative algorithm is more efficient than the recursive one.
